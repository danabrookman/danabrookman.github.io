				As an emerging BIM professional based in Toronto, I am passionate about
				creating thoughtful, functional spaces that balance creativity with
				technical precision. My work reflects a commitment to craft, material
				honesty, and a deep understanding of how design shapes daily experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to my formal training, I also create handmade, small-batch
				pottery — a practice that informs my approach to texture, form, and the
				tactile quality of space. This connection to craftsmanship grounds my
				digital work, where I explore parametric design and advanced modeling.
			</p>
			<p>
				This portfolio presents a selection of academic and independent projects
				across residential, commercial, and institutional sectors. Each project
				highlights my ability to move seamlessly between conceptual design,
				technical documentation, and digital fabrication workflows — always with
				a focus on clarity, quality, and human-centered design.
