				I work as a BIM consultant, usually getting involved when projects feel
				technically “correct” but still aren’t working the way anyone expected.
				Models exist, processes are in place, and yet teams are misaligned on
				what the information actually means, who can rely on it, and where the
				risk really sits. That gap between what BIM promises and what it
				delivers in practice is where I tend to focus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of my work starts with projects that are already underway. Design
				teams are modeling in good faith, contractors are asking reasonable
				questions, and owners are expecting clarity that the current setup can’t
				quite provide. Common triggers are vague BIM execution plans, LOD
				language that’s being interpreted differently by different parties, or
				models that look authoritative but were never meant to support the uses
				being demanded of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				My approach is less about tools and more about intent. I help teams slow
				down and make explicit decisions about what the model is for at each
				stage, what it is not for, and what assumptions are being carried
				forward. That often means translating BIM language into terms that
				commercial, legal, and delivery teams can actually act on, and
				identifying where expectations need to be reset before they harden into
				disputes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Engagements vary, but they typically involve reviewing BIM
				documentation, stress-testing proposed model uses, clarifying
				responsibility and reliance, or advising on how information should
				transition from design into construction. The goal is not to add process
				for its own sake, but to reduce friction and false certainty before they
				become expensive.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you’re working on a project where BIM feels like it should be helping
				more than it is, I’m always open to a conversation.
