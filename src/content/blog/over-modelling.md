There is a persistent belief in BIM that more detail automatically leads to better outcomes, but that assumption rarely holds up in practice. Over-modeling often shifts effort toward refining elements that carry little decision value, while more important uncertainties remain unresolved. Teams end up spending time polishing geometry instead of clarifying intent, and the model becomes visually impressive without being meaningfully more useful.

As models grow denser, they also become noisier. Excessive detail makes coordination harder, not easier, by obscuring critical interfaces behind layers of secondary information. It can create false confidence, where downstream users assume precision implies readiness, even though key inputs are still provisional. Performance suffers, updates slow down, and small design changes ripple unpredictably through the model.

The real cost of over-modeling is not computational, it is cognitive. When everything is treated as equally resolved, teams lose the ability to see what still matters. Effective BIM requires deliberate restraint, modeling just enough to support the decisions at hand and no more. Without that discipline, detail becomes a distraction rather than a source of clarity.
